# Vumalang

Vumalang is the official writing system for the Vumanoids universe. The Vumanoids universe is made up of 3 non-fungible token (NFT) collections on the VeChain blockchain: 7777 vElves, 6776 vales and unknown amount of hybrids.

Based on the English language, the script is made up of the letter `V`. There are no curved lines. Only diagonal and horizontal lines are used. Hugely inspired by Katakana, the Japanese writing system.
